047=This Script is originally based on the Windows Software 'LigaManager 98 Free' from Frank Hollwitz. The <strong>Liga Manager Online</strong>, also developed by Frank Hollwitz, is a greatly improved version of the Program. Since it is based on PHP, the LMO works with many OS and is comfortably managed with a normal Web-browser. With many different 3rd Party Addons, the LMO has become more flexible. Since the original author, Frank Hollwitz, has stopped improving the script, a group of Add-on developers have decided to work together with the goal of improving and and updating the script.
048=With this script it is possible to mánage <strong>Normal Leagues</strong> of different Sports, and also<strong>Tournaments</strong>. In addition there is also a <strong>Prediction Game</strong> a <strong>Players Management/Statistics</strong>, the support for mobile devices(cellular phones)<strong>WAP</strong> and a large <strong>League Statistics</strong> included. All this makes the LMO the <strong>Complete Solution</strong> for everyone who manages Sport Leagues and wants to make them publicly viewable.
049=Since this script is server based, it does not depend on a Web-browser. The Web-browser should however work with CSS for best results. When the Webmaster uses the added News-ticker, it will only be shown when JavaScript is aktivated.
